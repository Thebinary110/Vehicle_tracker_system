### Future Add-ons
These advanced features are planned for the next version:

### Speed Alert System:
If the bus speed exceeds the legal/safe limit (e.g., 40 km/h in school zones), an emergency shoutout will be displayed or spoken aloud.

### Smart Route Danger Detection:
Using a mock API, if there's any construction, road block, or accident reported ahead on the path ‚Äî the system will advise to reroute or slow down.

### AI-Based Rerouting:
Suggest alternative roads dynamically if a blockage is detected.

### Destination ETA Prediction:
Based on current speed and remaining distance.

### Multi-Bus Simulation:
Simulate multiple buses on the same map with different routes.

### Upload Route JSON:
Import routes from previously saved JSON files.
